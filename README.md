Here, I demonstrate that machine learning (ML) classification models can predict the potential niche of the tree species Pinus monophylla (commonly known as the singleleaf pinyon pine). Using an ensemble of climate projections from statistically downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the 5th Couple Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), I project how the potential niche of the single-leaf pinyon pines may change due to anthropogenic climate change. 

The idea of this project originated from an earlier class project, where I used a random forest classifier to perform a similar analysis on the potential range of distribution for the singly-leaf pinyon pines in California. Here, I'm interested in expanding the scope of that earlier project and instead predict the range in the whole domain of the single-leaf pinyon pine's habitat, namely California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. This proved to be a harder goal to achieve, and instead of using random forest, I ended up using a multilayer perceptron to classify the pines' range of distribution and used this model to project how this distribution might change under the impact of climate change.
